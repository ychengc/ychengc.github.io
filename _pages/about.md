Chengcheng Yang (杨程程 in Chinese) is a research professor at School of Data Science and Engineering, [East China Normal University (ECNU)](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/). Prior to joining ECNU, he was a postdoctoral researcher at School of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering (CEMSE), [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en). He was also a research associate at [Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.inceptioniai.org/en) (Abu Dhabi, UAE), and a senior engineer at [Shanghai Huawei Technology Co. Ltd](https://www.huawei.com/en/). He botained both of his Ph.D. degree (2017) and B.S. degree (2012) from School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China. His research interests focus on database systems, storage engines, in-database machine learning, and implementing database internals with AI.
